Description
-----------

Hosts is a Ruby library able to read or manipulate the operating system's host
files. When manipulating it tries to preserve their original formatting.

Features / Problems
-------------------

This project tries to conform to:

* [Semantic Versioning (2.0.0-rc.1)][semver]
* [Ruby Packaging Standard (0.5-draft)][rps]
* [Ruby Style Guide][style]
* [Gem Packaging: Best Practices][gem]

   [semver]: http://semver.org/
   [rps]:    http://chneukirchen.github.com/rps/
   [style]:  https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide
   [gem]:    http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/9/1/gem-packaging-best-practices

Additional facts:

* Written purely in Ruby.
* Documented with YARD.
* Intended to be used with Ruby 1.8.7 or higher.
* Cryptographically signed gem and git tags.

Synopsis
--------

This documentation defines the public interface of the software. Don't rely
on elements marked as private. Those should be hidden in the documentation
by default.

### Loading

In most cases you want to load the library by the following command:

~~~~~ ruby
require 'hosts'
~~~~~

In a bundler Gemfile you should use the following:

~~~~~ ruby
gem 'hosts'
~~~~~

Requirements
------------

* Ruby 1.8.7 or higher

Installation
------------

On *nix systems you may need to prefix the command with sudo to get root
privileges.

### High security (recommended)

There is a high security installation option available through rubygems. It is
highly recommended over the normal installation, although it may be a bit less
comfortable. To use the installation method, you will need my [gem signing
public key][gemkey], which I use for cryptographic signatures on all my gems.

Add the key to your rubygems' trusted certificates by the following command:

    gem cert --add aef-gem.pem

Now you can install the gem while automatically verifying it's signature by the
following command:

    gem install hosts -P HighSecurity

Please notice that you may need other keys for dependent libraries, so you may
have to install dependencies manually.

   [gemkey]: http://aef.name/crypto/aef-gem.pem

### Normal

    gem install hosts

### Automated testing

Go into the root directory of the installed gem and run the following command
to fetch all development dependencies:

    bundle

Afterwards start the test runner:

    rake spec

If something goes wrong you should be noticed through failing examples.

Development

### Bugs Reports and Feature Requests

Please use the [issue tracker][issues] on github.com to let me know about errors
or ideas for improvement of this software.

   [issues]: https://github.com/aef/hosts/issues/

### Source code

This software is developed in the source code management system git hosted
at github.com. You can download the most recent sourcecode through the
following command:

    git clone https://github.com/aef/hosts.git

The final commit before each released gem version will be marked by a tag
named like the version with a prefixed lower-case "v", as required by Semantic
Versioning. Every tag will be signed by my [OpenPGP public key][openpgp] which
enables you to verify your copy of the code cryptographically.

   [openpgp]: http://aef.name/crypto/aef-openpgp.asc

Add the key to your GnuPG keyring by the following command:

    gpg --import aef-openpgp.asc

This command will tell you if your code is of integrity and authentic:

    git tag -v [TAG NAME]

### Contribution

Help on making this software better is always very appreciated. If you want
your changes to be included in the official release, please clone my project
on github.com, create a named branch to commit and push your changes into and
send me a pull request afterwards.

Please make sure to write tests for your changes so that I won't break them
when changing other things on the library. Also notice that I can't promise
to include your changes before reviewing them.
